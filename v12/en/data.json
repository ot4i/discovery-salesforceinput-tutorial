Click Send and your message is sent to the HTTPInput node. You will receive a JSON reply message which looks like this:<br><code>{\"message\":\"Request received, about to connect to Salesforce\"}</code><br>  You may also see a highlighted path through the flow. Sometimes there may be a short pause before the data is returned from Salesforce, so you may need to click the View Path icon <img src='http://ot4i.github.io/iib-tutorials/images/icons/iib/viewPath.png' alt='View path' /> in the Flow Exerciser toolbar in order to see the highlighted path carry on past the Salesforce Request node and into a Trace node at the end of the message flow. If the message left the Salesforce Request node down the out terminal then the Create contact in Salesforce will have been successful. If not, inspect the exception list to see what went wrong. Assuming success, switch to <span class='resource'>ExampleSalesforceInputFlow.msgflow</span> and click the View Path icon <img src='http://ot4i.github.io/iib-tutorials/images/icons/iib/viewPath.png' alt='View path' /> in the Flow Exerciser toolbar in order to see the highlighted path. You should see a message has been propagated out of the out terminal of the Salesforce Input node. Click on the highlighted path and the message should contain the same contact information which was sent to Salesforce by the first message flow."
